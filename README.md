# Sample Android Projects

These are simple stopwatch and calculator applications I created to get a feel for Android Studio.

# Potential improvements
- Optimization: The sizes of the stopwatch and calculator applications are 18 and 22 MB respectively. In comparison, the pre-built stopwatch and calculator applications that come with the Android device are both less than 100 KB.
- Additional features: The stopwatch can have features such as Lap time and the Calculator can have features similar to a scientific one such as trigonometric and more complex functions.
- Aesthetics: Both apps are very generic and can be improved immensely in terms of style and aesthetics.
